# Project Name
> This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the demand for shared bikes in the American market. 

Bike-sharing systems are a growing trend in urban transportation, offering a convenient and eco-friendly alternative to traditional modes of travel. However, accurately predicting demand for these shared bikes is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and maximizing profits. 

This project aims to develop a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes in the US market. The model will utilize data from a US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, to identify key factors influencing rental volume and assess their impact. 

By analyzing factors like weather conditions, seasonality, and year, we hope to gain valuable insights into user behavior and support BoomBikes in developing a data-driven strategy to meet customer needs and enhance their business operations.

## General Information
This project focuses on building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes offered by BoomBikes across the US. The model leverages historical data provided by BoomBikes, encompassing various factors believed to influence rental volume.

**Background:** Bike-sharing systems are gaining popularity, offering an eco-friendly and convenient alternative to traditional transportation. However, accurately predicting demand for these bikes is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and maximizing profits. 

**Business Problem:** BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, seeks to understand the factors influencing demand for their services post-pandemic. This will help them prepare to meet customer needs, stand out from competitors, and increase revenue.

**Dataset:** The project utilizes a dataset provided by BoomBikes, containing data on daily bike rentals, weather conditions, seasonality, and potentially other relevant features.

### Goals and Expected Outcomes
The primary goal of this project is to construct a robust multiple linear regression model capable of predicting the demand for shared bikes offered by BoomBikes across the American market. This model will be built upon historical data provided by BoomBikes, encompassing various factors believed to influence rental volume.

By analyzing these factors, we aim to achieve the following outcomes:

Identify Significant Factors: The model will reveal which variables among the provided data set hold the most significant influence on the demand for shared bikes. This will provide BoomBikes with a clear understanding of the key drivers impacting their business.

Predict Demand Levels: The trained model will be able to predict the expected number of bike rentals based on the input features. This information will be instrumental in optimizing resource allocation, ensuring sufficient bikes are available at high-demand locations and times.

Inform Business Strategy: The insights gained from the model's performance and the identified significant factors will inform BoomBikes' business strategy. This can lead to targeted marketing campaigns, strategic pricing adjustments, and improved operational efficiency.

Ultimately, this project aspires to equip BoomBikes with a valuable tool for understanding and predicting bike-sharing demand. This knowledge will empower them to make informed decisions, enhance customer satisfaction, and solidify their position within the growing bike-sharing market.

### Steps Involved in Building a Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Model:
1. Data Acquisition: Obtain the bike-sharing data provided by BoomBikes. This data will likely include information on factors like daily rental counts, weather conditions, seasonality, and potentially other relevant features.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, converting categorical variables with ordinal encoding to strings for proper interpretation by the model, and checking for outliers.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain an initial understanding of the data by performing visualizations and calculating summary statistics. This step helps identify relationships between features and the target variable (bike rental count).

4. Feature Engineering: Based on the findings from EDA, consider creating new features, transformations or dummy variables that might improve model performance. This could involve interaction terms between existing features or deriving new features based on domain knowledge.

5. Train-Test Split: Divide the data into two sets: a training set used to build the model and a testing set used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

6. Model Building: Choose and implement a multiple linear regression model. Train the model on the training data, allowing it to learn the relationships between features and the target variable.

7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set. This typically involves calculating metrics like R-squared score, which indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. Additionally, perform residual analysis to check for model assumptions and identify potential issues.

8. Interpretation: Analyze the model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on the predicted bike rental count. Additionally, consider feature importances (if applicable) to identify the most influential factors.

## Conclusions
1. **Significant Factors:** The model will identify key factors significantly impacting bike-sharing demand, allowing BoomBikes to focus on these aspects for strategic optimization.
2. **Demand Prediction:** The trained model will predict the expected number of bike rentals based on input features. This information can be used to optimize resource allocation and ensure sufficient bike availability at high-demand locations and times.
3. **Informed Business Strategy:** Insights from the model's performance and identified significant factors will inform BoomBikes' business strategy. This can lead to targeted marketing campaigns, strategic pricing adjustments, and improved operational efficiency.
4. **Future Improvement:**  The project establishes a baseline model. Future work can explore more advanced algorithms and data sources for potentially improved prediction accuracy.
5. Key variables that influence the rental demand are as follows:
  - holiday - Positive Coorelation
  - atemp (Feeling Temperature) - Positive Correlation
  - hum - Negative Correlation
  - windspeed - Negative Correlation
  - Season - Spring and Fall
  - months - Sept - good, Jan, Feb, Nov, Dec - Not so good
  - Year (2019)
  - weathersit - Avoid Bad Weather

BoomBikes can take measures to attact rentals as follows:

Company should focus on expanding business during September and during Spring and Fall when weather is pleasant
Expect reduced bookings during Light Snow or Rain.
